//! An asynchronous abstraction for discovering devices and services on a network.
//!
//! SSDP stands for Simple Service Discovery Protocol and it is a protocol that uses
//! HTTPMU to distribute messages across a local network for devices and services to
//! discover each other. SSDP can most commonly be found in devices that implement
//! `UPnP` as it is used as the discovery mechanism for that standard.
